# EMsoftOO

A first attempt to convert the core of the EMsoft package to Object Oriented fortran-2018...

This project will start by generating a cell class for crystal structures; then we add a symmetry class for all the space group symmetries.  Combining those two will lead to a simple program to generate a crystal structure file, which will also require a new HDF class.

The goal is to learn how to work in this programming mode, while also creating a completely new version of EMsoft (in the long run...).
